- Next-Token Mapping Heads
	- *L3H11 attends to ADJ and VRB from ADJ and VRB and subsequent positions (7 and 10) as well as the subsequent+1 positions (8 and 11), and writes in the sentiment direction most strongly at ADJ+1 and VRB+1/+2.*
	- **L5H7** attends slightly to ADJ from **ADJ+1**, and strongly to **VRB** from VRB+1. It strongly writes in the sentiment direction at **ADJ+1** and VRB+1.
