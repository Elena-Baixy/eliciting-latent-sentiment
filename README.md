#### Disclaimers
This is research code and we sincerely apologise for not having time to neatly package it up. The most friendly and reusable code can be found in the `utils` directory. We will try to draw attention to other key scripts here which might be of use to others. The Dockerfile should be sufficient to run most of this code. We forked `CircuitsVis` as a sub-module in order to make a couple of small changes used to generate cleaner figures for this paper.

#### Acknowledgements
Stanford Sentiment Treebank was downloaded from https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/index.html

We are very grateful to Neel Nanda for his mentorship and the transformer-lens library.

SERI MATS provided funding for this research.

#### Training the sentiment direction
In `fit_directions.py`, you can specify 
* a list of models (e.g. `gpt2-small`)
* a list of methods (e.g. `das`, `kmeans`, `logistic_regression`)
* a list of training datasets (we generally use `simple_train`)
* a list of test datasets to use for evaluation during training (can just use `none` to save code time)
* a scaffold (only necessary if using Stanford Sentiment Treebank): either `continuation` or `classification`.

Then the for-loop between `# Training loop` and `# # END OF ACTUAL DIRECTION FITTING` is the critical section.

This writes the directions to numpy files like `data/gpt2-small/kmeans_simple_train_ADJ_layer1.npy`. The file names are fairly self-explanatory but for completeness, there is a directory per model then the file name states the method, training data, token position and residual stream layer.

The only exception are the random directions which are generated by `random_directions.py`.

#### Patching the sentiment direction
In `direction_patching_suite.py`, you can select
* a list of models
* a list of filename patterns to load as directions
* a list of evaluation datasets
* a scaffold (if using Treebank)
* a list of patching metrics (see `utils/circuit_analysis.py::PatchingMetric`).
 runs 
The for-loop at the bottom of the file performs the directional activation patching experiments and writes the results to CSVs with names that begin `direction_patching_`.

Then `direction_patching_results.py` is a very quick and basic script to generate the plots shown in the paper using the cached CSV files from the first step.

#### Treebank data
Before the Treebank dataset can be used, it is necessary to first run `treebank_data_gen.py` to write pickle files locally.
